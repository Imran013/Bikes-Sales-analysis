# \# Bike Sales Data Analysis

# 

# This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs \*\*data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization\*\* on a bike sales dataset.

# 

# \## 📊 Project Overview

# The goal of this project is to analyze sales data of bikes in order to understand:

# \- Sales trends across time (monthly/yearly revenue)

# \- Customer demographics (age groups, gender)

# \- Profitability by product category and country

# \- Outliers and data quality issues

# 

# \## ⚙️ Features

# \- Load dataset from Excel

# \- Handle missing values and duplicates

# \- Convert and clean numerical and date columns

# \- Detect and visualize outliers

# \- Perform groupby analysis (by category, gender, age group, country, etc.)

# \- Create visualizations with Seaborn and Matplotlib

#
